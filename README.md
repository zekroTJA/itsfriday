# Why?

Imagine waking up, looking on your phone and noticing: It's finally friday! You are going to work, full of aniticipation to the end of the workday - chilling with some beer or with your freinds on a tasty barbeque...

And this tool provides an easy way to spread some of your friday-happiness to your twitter followers! Just enter a collection of carefully picked, happy friday images into the config, create an [API app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and enter your apps credentials and everything is ready to go.

Then, you can define a time when a randomly picked image out of the defined pool of files and URLs will be directly brought onto your followers timeline.
